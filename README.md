## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To install PyEncoder, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FTWGaming/Pyencoder.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Pyencoder
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have Python installed. Use pip to install any required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:

   You can now run the PyEncoder script. Check the usage section for commands.

## Usage üìú

Using PyEncoder is straightforward. Here‚Äôs how to encode your Python files:

1. **Basic Encoding Command**:

   ```bash
   python pyencoder.py your_script.py
   ```

   This command will encode `your_script.py` and generate an obfuscated output file.

2. **Multi-layer Encoding**:

   To apply multiple layers of encoding, use the `--layers` option:

   ```bash
   python pyencoder.py your_script.py --layers 3
   ```

3. **Reverse String Obfuscation**:

   If you want to obfuscate specific strings in your code, use the `--obfuscate` option:

   ```bash
   python pyencoder.py your_script.py --obfuscate
   ```

4. **Compiling to .pyc**:

   To compile your script into a `.pyc` file, use the `--compile` option:

   ```bash
   python pyencoder.py your_script.py --compile
   ```

5. **Help Command**:

   For more options, you can always run:

   ```bash
   python pyencoder.py --help
   ```

## Encoding Techniques üîê

PyEncoder employs several encoding techniques to secure your scripts:

- **Marshal**: This method serializes Python objects, allowing you to store and retrieve them easily.
- **Zlib**: A compression library that reduces the size of your encoded files, making them less readable.
- **Base Encodings**: Using base16, base32, and base64 encodings to further obfuscate your scripts.

Each technique adds a layer of complexity, making it harder for unauthorized users to understand your code.

## Compatibility üñ•Ô∏è

PyEncoder works seamlessly across different operating systems:

- **Windows**: Fully supported with easy installation.
- **Linux**: Tested on various distributions, ensuring reliable performance.
- **Termux**: Works well on Android devices with Termux installed.

No matter where you are developing, PyEncoder has you covered.
